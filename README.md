# Credit-Risk-Assessment
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to assess credential risk in financial systems. It classifies credentials into Low, Medium, or High Risk based on historical data, enhancing security and fraud detection.

ðŸš€ Features
Risk classification using Random Forest
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers)
Feature engineering to improve model performance
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Machine Learning (Random Forest, Decision Trees)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
